 Curran Computer Science Final Project Write up

My project was a calculator that also had another page where it links to my GitHub account so someone who is impressed with my project can check out other projects that I’ve made. I’m proud of this project because it took a lot of research to figure out how to turn the text field inputs into variables I could use for the equations and operators.

1. on my project I used the tab bar controller just to basically be able to smoothly and easily transition between the two pages, I chose this over just another view controller because the mini buttons are satisfying and also it allocates the memory a lot more efficiently.
2. I used view controllers for both of the windows that my project has, I chose this because I felt that I was most comfortable coding for a view controller rather than a tab bar or another kind of screen. 
3. Buttons were extremely important in my project because I used them for the operators on my calculator, and I also used buttons to activate sounds and alerts for the calculator. I used another button to open up the webpage I had linked on my second page. Buttons were an easy and practical way for me to use actions to execute the code how I wanted to.
4. I used labels for the directions mostly, but I also used one as an output for the result of the calculations. I coded it to update the label when the calculation was completed.
5.  I used the web kit view to open up the webpage with my GitHub profile on this so people can see my other projects I’ve made in the past if they were interested in doing so.
6. I used alerts to give a warning error if someone didn’t put any text into the two fields, if I didn’t do this and someone tried to calculate with no values there’d be an error so I used an if else statement to cleverly avoid this error by giving a friendly pop up window, I also used alerts that would display the result of the calculation.
7. I used the audio toolbox to give an auditory confirmation that the calculation had been made correctly, I thought the “you got mail” wav would be humorous… maybe not.
8.I used text fields to collect the two variables being calculated in which case depending on which operator you clicked it would either subtract add, divide, or multiply the 2 items. I was originally going to use buttons, but I couldn’t figure out how to do that and also the text fields actually give you more range.
9. I used an image view to show “the valley” which is what I called my calculator for some reason so that was the use for the image view.
10. I used a slider for the ‘rating’ system which doesn’t actually collect any data I just thought it would be a funny joke for the ratings to go nowhere so that’s basically what it does it was kind of a sarcastic piece of humor for the app.

Overall I am happy with the way the calculator turned out and loading in my GitHub I thought was cool and all of the sounds and messages I added along to it I am happy with all I’ve learned this year and I’m excited to keep taking programming classes.
